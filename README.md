# Identifying-the-topics-from-the-questions-asked-by-Amazon-customers

**Problem Statement:** Understanding the pain points of the Amazon customers while purchasing a product or the queries they have after purchasing a product.<br><br>
**Proposed Solution:** We will identify the most common topics from the questions asked by the customers on Amazon using Topic Modelling method. These topics will help us understand the most common questions which can then be used to improve the product descriptions or the product itself in a particular category.<br><br>
Here, I will be identifying the topics from the questions asked in Automotive category.
